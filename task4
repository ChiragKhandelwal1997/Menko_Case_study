task 4


For commiting this task I need a whole database and azure account to extract these files into Database and transform these data. If you can provide me that I can do it 
for sure. 
Approach-
1) To change the datetime into Date only we use SQL Query - Cast or convert function
for example- SELECT CAST('2024-04-28 17:26:36.710' AS DATE) AS CURRENT_DATE

2)To handle the null value we use multiple functions - ISNULL or Coalesce
these two functions remove the null value and return the first not null value

3)to handle the duplicate records we can use distinct function or we can run particular query
select column1, column2, count(*) from table_name 
group by column1, column2 
having count(*) >= 2
With the help of this we find the duplicate records and we will delete these duplicate records

4)For changing the currency in euros we can create a currency table and insert all the currency name and the value of that currency in euros
After that we will join this table with all the other tables separately and update the main table records

5) To identify the mightiest region we have to join all the tables with each other and create a single table. After that we will run a query to indentify 
the maximum no of gold coins . with this we will be able to identify the wealthiest region.

6)And for the remaining task I need a reporting tool or visualisation tool for the graph or charts preparation.
