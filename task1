We can use Azure Cloud and its various tools and technologies to solve the problem of Amazon Seller.
1) Extration and Storage
Data extration simply means to extract the data from Source side and transfer it to the sink side. For that we can use various tools in azure like SSIS and 
Azure Data Factory(ADF) which is the advance version of SSIS. ADF is Azure cloud based technology used to create, schedule and orchestrate data pipeline for ingesting
Data from various source.For this scenario we have to create a Copy Data Activity Pipeline which extract Data from multiple source and dump the Data into our
Blob Storage or adls gen2 storage. These are the storage account provided by azure use to store large volumes of data. 

2)Batch processing and Analysis
The data is stored in adls gen2 storage. Now this data is sent into Azure Databricks for Batch processing and for the transformation purpose.
Databricks is a big data analytical tool based on top of spark used for analytical purpose. In this we can transform raw data into useful insights and 
also do the transformation on it. Suppose if we want to add some column or do filter on certain table we can do it. more importantly it can also create
Graphs to do some visualisation part. But for the visualisation I can strongly prefer Some visualisation tool because it provide lots of functionality.
Apart from Databricks we can also use synapse which is newer version of SQl Datawarehouse.

3)Automation
For the automation part Azure provides logic app for that. With the help of logic app we can schedule and trigger data extraction, transformation and 
loading tasks based on predefined schedules or events.
